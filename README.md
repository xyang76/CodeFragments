# CodeFragments
Include different codes of mine.
Some of my skills have no code fragment because of 2 reasons:

1. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
2. I lost them in these years(I changed 4 computers.)

Programming Skills:

1. Java(Spring/Struts/Hibernate, Android): Gson, Regex, Socket, Annotation etc.

2. Javascript(JQuery, ExtJS): Json, Ajax, Prototype and Function(Object) programming.

3. SQL(Oracle, SQLServer): 

4. C#: 

5. C/C++: I learned C in 2006 and good at pointer, and I learned C++ in 2010, I can do programming in C++.

6. Assembly: I learned in 2013, and I shared some assembly code fragments of CS402 Homework.
